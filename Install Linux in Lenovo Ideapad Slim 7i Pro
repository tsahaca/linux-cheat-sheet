== To fix the keyboard and the screen flickering
To fix the keyboard and the screen flickering (tested on manjaro 5.13 kernel and ubuntu 21.04), 
change your grub config entry named GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub to:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="i915.enable_psr=0 i8042.direct i8042.dumbkbd"
Type sudo update-grub and reboot.
The first one fixes the flickering, the rest the keyboard.
You can press e on a distro while installing and add the lines to the installer and start it with ctrl x aswell.
